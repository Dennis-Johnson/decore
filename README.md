Deep Compression with Reinforcement Learning. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06091)
This is a PyTorch implementation of the DECORE compression algorithm. 

TODO:
1. Improve the wrapper over the custom structured pruning flow in PyTorch. 
2. Add REINFORCE-based RL agents before CNN layers that dictate which channels to prune.
