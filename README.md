# DECORE
Deep Compression with Reinforcement Learning. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06091)

This is a PyTorch implementation of the DECORE compression algorithm. 

Milestones:
1. Fine-tune a CNN style network on a simple dataset. 
2. Implement a wrapper over the custom structured pruning flow in PyTorch. 
3. Add REINFORCE based RL agents before CNN and Linear layers to decide how to prune. 
4. Profit.
